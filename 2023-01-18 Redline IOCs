THREAT ATTRIBUTION:  REDLINE STEALER

NOTES
This sample was found doing routine "Google Ad" searches for popular software - in this case, it was Rufus.
I saw an ad near the bottom of the first search results page which pointed to a suspicious url.
When I clicked the result, I was taken to a page which, at a glance, seemed to be what I would expect.
It was meant to look like a legitimate Rufus web page.
There is a link on the page to download the installer (which I clicked).
This downloaded a .zip file which, after extracting, contained a gigantic 640 MB executable.
In this case, the executable is a .NET binary which is protected by .NET Reactor.
I was able extract the actual "regular size" binary and it was only ~1.3 KB.
All of the C2 traffic that I saw consisted of TCP Retransmissions.
